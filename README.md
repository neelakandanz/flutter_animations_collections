# 🌀 Advanced Flutter Animation Series (Canvas & CustomPainter)

Welcome to the **Advanced Flutter Animation Series** — a creative journey where we push the limits of Flutter's `CustomPainter`, `Canvas`, and animation framework to craft real-world product visuals entirely from code.

## 🎯 Goal

This project is built to demonstrate how you can create **complex, high-fidelity animations** in Flutter without relying on icons, images, or external assets. Every element you see — from curves to waves to motion paths — is hand-drawn using the powerful combination of `Canvas`, `Path`, and animation controllers.

## 🚀 What You'll Learn

- Building custom UI using `CustomPainter` and `Canvas`
- Animating visuals using `AnimationController`, `Tween`, `CurvedAnimation`
- Drawing product-inspired objects from scratch
- Adding interaction or physics-based effects to custom components
- Creative problem-solving with math (waves, arcs, curves)

## 📂 Structure

Each file in this repository is a self-contained example of one visual animation. All code is written in Dart using Flutter and is intended to be easy to explore and modify.

## 🔓 License & Usage

All animations and source code in this series are **free to use**, modify, and remix for your own projects, learning, or fun. Attribution is appreciated but not required.

## 🤝 Contributions

Feel free to submit improvements, new animation ideas, or fixes. Whether you're just starting with Flutter or you're deep into creative UI work, you're welcome to collaborate.

### 💡 Made for the Flutter community — because animations should be expressive, not restrictive.
